{"name":"Nyuzi Processor","tagline":"A scalable parallel processor hardware design in SystemVerilog.","body":"# Nyuzi\r\n\r\nThis project is a multicore, SIMD processor designed for highly parallel computation. It was inspired by Intel's Larrabee, although the instruction set and microarchitecture are substantially different. The design philosophy is to distribute work across many cache coherent cores, each with multiple hardware threads and a wide vector arithmetic unit. While traditional GPUs use fixed function hardware to schedule execution, this design controls it using software. This gives increased flexibility for complex workloads that are becoming more common.","google":"UA-36259737-2","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
