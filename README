This project is a vector co-processor, suitable for general purpose parallel processing or visual computing.  Documentation is in the wiki: https://github.com/jbush001/VectorProc/wiki

Requires:
* python 2.7
* bison 
* flex 
* Icarus Verilog 
* GNU Make 
* gcc

Optionally:
* emacs + verilog mode tools, for AUTOWIRE (http://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilog-mode) (note that using 'make autos' in the rtl/ directory will run this operation in batch mode if the tools are installed)
* Java (J2SE 6+) for visualizer app 
* GTKWave (or similar) for analyzing trace files

To build tools and verilog models:

  From the top directory, type 'make'
  
Running verification tests (in verilog simulation)

  cd tests/directed_verification
  ./runtest.py
  cd tests/randomizer
  ./runtest.py regression/*.hex

Running 3D rendering engine (in verilog simulation)

  cd firmware/3d-engine
  make vsim

  Output framebuffer image goes into vsim.bmp
